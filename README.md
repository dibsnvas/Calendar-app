# Calendar App

This is a simple calendar app built with React that displays a monthly calendar view. Each date cell shows a status that represents if an employee was on time, late, or absent, along with whether they finished their tasks. Users can click on a date to view details in a modal window.

## Features

- **Calendar View**: Displays days of the current month in a structured grid format.
- **Date Status**: Each date cell is color-coded based on the employee's work status:
  - Green: Employee worked and completed tasks on time.
  - Yellow: Employee worked but did not complete tasks.
  - Red: Employee was late and did not complete tasks.
  - Gray: Either the day is a weekend, or the employee did not need to work on that day.
- **Modal Details**: Clicking on a date opens a modal window that displays detailed information for that day.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
